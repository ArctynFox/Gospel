# The Gospel

Gospel is a cli tool to convert the data tables of the PC versions Trails in the Sky trilogy into a modifiable .json format which can then be recompiled to a .\_dt. This is intended to make it easier to modify and add content to the games' data tables, as they are very tedious to modify without some sort of automatic tool.

This project *only* intends to be able to convert the .\_dt files to json and back. It is designed to be used in tandem with [Factoria](https://github.com/Aureole-Suite/Factoria).
